## Revolut Example

The main purpose for this example is to show oracle developers how to implement oracle scripts
using the Blocksense SDK

This example provides data to two different data feeds:

- "USD/BTC"
- "USD/ETH"

The example fetches data from Revolut API and based on the Data Feed ID
returns it in the proper type which is stored on the blockchain.
